# CLI App

This repository contains a hands-on project adapted from the Let's Get Rusty bootcamp. The project is a command-line interface (CLI) application implemented entirely from scratch.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a practical learning experience with Rust by building a functional CLI application. The project plan follows the structure provided by the Let's Get Rusty bootcamp, but all code has been written independently.

## Features

- Command-line argument parsing
- Subcommands for different functionalities
- Error handling
- Modular code structure

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and build the application using Cargo:

```sh
git clone /Users/stephensaunders/r/rust/letsGetRusty/cli_app/cli_app
cd cli_app
cargo build
```

## Usage

Run the application with the following command:

```sh
cargo run -- <your-arguments>
```

Replace `<your-arguments>` with the appropriate command-line arguments for your use case.
